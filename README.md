Euchre-Bot
==========

An implementation of the card game euchre and a bot to play it.
It currently has two bots; a random play bot and a simple stat bot. Both bots play within the rules.
The simple stat bot uses some knowledge of the rules of the game to determine the what cards the other players may or may not have, then makes a move based upon that. Rather simplistic and arbitrary.
